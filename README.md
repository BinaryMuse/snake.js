Snake.js
========

This project, which as of yet does not have a clever name, is a JavaScript/canvas implementation of the classic [Snake game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)). Unlike many implementations, which are designed to demonstrate basic canvas game programming, this one has a few more features and a little more polish. It uses the [CreateJS suite of libraries](http://createjs.com/#!/CreateJS).
